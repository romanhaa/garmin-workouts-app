The watch displays a timer for the 30-second exercises followed by 10-second rest period (configurable).

Number of exercises, duration of exercises and rest periods are configurable on the watch menu or through Garmin Connect Mobile.
Vibration and sound notification is supported based on the watch features.

Four activity types are available:

 - 7-minute workout: 13 exercises from HICT program are repeated, activity is saved as cardio training
 - Cardio: activity is saved as cardio training
 - Strength: activity is saved as strength training
 - Flexibility: activity is saved as flexibility training, but Garmin Connect displays it as "Strength Training"

The application supports heart-rate monitor (HRM) and temperature sensor (Tempe).

Use the menu button to configure:

 - Activity type
 - Number of exercises
 - Duration of exercise, in seconds
 - Duration of rest period, in seconds
 - Notification policy: none, start and end, every 10 seconds

If you achieve at least half of the session, the activity is recorded in your Garmin profile.

The activity in your Garmin profile will include basic information such as date, time, total activity time and laps.
 - Each exercise and rest period corresponds to a lap.
 - Heart-rate graph is included if a heart-rate monitor is used.
 - Temperature graph is included if a temperature sensor is used.
 - Calories will be automatically calculated if and only if a heart-rate monitor is used.
